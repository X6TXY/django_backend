Token-based Access: Utilizes tokens for authentication, ensuring secure access to specific endpoints.
Test Endpoint: Validates user tokens to grant access to protected resources.
API Endpoints:
Login Endpoint: Allows existing users to authenticate by providing their credentials.
Signup Endpoint: Registers new users securely into the system.
Test Token Endpoint: Verifies token-based authentication by granting access to authenticated users.
Technologies Used:
Django: The robust web framework for building powerful web applications.
Django Rest Framework: Simplifies API creation by providing tools for authentication, serialization, and more.
Token Authentication: Implements token-based authentication for secure API access.
Python: Utilized as the primary programming language for backend logic.
